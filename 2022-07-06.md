# Report of July 6th 2022
## Summary: 
| Date | Tasks
| :--        |:--   |
| 6/30 | Started reading on what RC team did to scan assets for UE5. Read more on laser and LiDAR Scanners. Went through Nikon Z7ii documentation. 
| 7/1 | I went to Oldenborg Center to take about 650 images with the Z7ii and created a LiDAR scan with Polycam in an iPhone 13. Processed the images taken on the day with Lightroom. Tried to create a model with them. 
| 7/4  | off-campus
| 7/5 | Finished the model that I started with the 650 pictures from 7/1/2022. The best alignment tool around 3 minutes with 472/650 cameras being recognized, more below. 
| 7/6 | Found a paper to read next week. Uploaded the edited 7/1/2022 images to the server. I kept on playing with the same model, started to read and expand my knowledge on RC tools like smoothing and cutting. 
## Activities:
   * read more on what the reality capture team did to scan the assest in UE5. I am just getting an idea though. It seems they used scanners like LiDAR and/ or laser scanners. 
   * I read the Nikon z7II documentation. https://kenrockwell.com/nikon/mirrorless/z7-ii-users-guide.htm#:~:text=MENU%20%3E%20CUSTOM%20SETTING%20MENU%20%28pencil%20icon%29%20%3E,mount%20optimized%20for%20Nikon%27s%20new%20Z-mount%20mirrorless%20lenses.
   * I read a quick guide on photogrammetry equipment. https://sophiedixon.gitbooks.io/photogrammetry-guide/content/photography/equipment.html
   * I turned off sleeping mode on the computer so the models could keep running while I worked on other things. 
   * Read a 2 min guide on indoor photogrammetry tips/ DIY solutions. https://metricaltalks.com/diy-solution-for-indoor-photogrammetry/.
   * Watched a quick video that showcases the differences of scanning with camera, laser, and both. This was for outdoor photography. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Uf8kjfbSA&t=2s
   * I shot about 650 images of the Oldenborg first floor hall. This is half of the ones we got last week, and model was as good if not better. out of these 650, around 500 were from the main hall, and the intersection/ loop were around 150. The model as overall efficient at about 472/500 of images of the hall being picked up. 
   * Created a model of Oldenborg with Polycam and LiDAR Scanner on the iPhone 13. https://poly.cam/capture/2D217508-45FB-4E99-9502-8B8D43D27430
   * Created a video of the model of the images. I am still playing around with RC, but it is a bit faster now. 
   * Found a paper on photogrammetry to read for next week. 
   * Checked out the camera for another 1-2 weeks. 
   * Used the spc -r command on the command line to upload images.
## Problems: 
  * The models from RC, although better from before, are still noisy and not as sharp as we wish them to be.
    I plan to read more on why there is noise and how to sharpen these models so that we start getting more realistic models. 
  * I plan to keep working on my skills to create photogrammetry models. However, I am unsure how to move forward, it feels like I am a bit stuck. 0
## Next steps: 
* Play more with the tools in RC to see if I can create a sharper model with the one I already have. Look into what generates noise in these models. Try to create a more realistic model. 
* Keep reading on how to do a better model.
* Take a 1 day break from phtogrammetry to work on something else.
