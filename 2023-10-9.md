# Report October 9th 2023
### Quick note/summary: 
I looked into LumaAI, read about Gaussian Splatting. Also created a model with LumaAI
## Activities/Went through: 
  * LumaAI:
    * Downloaded and set up LumaAI for my mobile device. and looked into the following tools:
      * Video to 3D API data: started working on the tutorial. As of now, I am setting up and figuring our how to run it. Idea is to run a video through it and then have a model. Note: it is $1 per capture. I also want to note that based on the models that I looked at, these NeRF models are similar enough in results as good photogrammetric models. 
      * Looked briefly into the exporting formats for this app.
      * There is another application that is implemented with this called Flythroughs. 
  * Gaussian Splatting: 
    * Read briefly through the abstact.
    * watched a video of guys working with Gaussian Splatting:
      * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juRMRej2d5c, not this video is just a reaction of some testing these guys ran.
      * it seems that this is the newest technology. To an extent, this might be better than LumaAI(they use NeRF).
      * it also seems this is nicer with iffy photography or inputs. It seems we can get point clouds too(still have to check if we can use them in UE5). 
## Moving Forward: 
  * Get a model going with LumaAI's video to 3D API data feature. Get the code going, and then get a video of an object to get going.
  * Get a model running with LumaAI's application(it is rendeing and preprocessing as of October 9th.
  * Look into interactive scenes here: https://lumalabs.ai/interactive-scenes
  * Either this week or the one after, I want to look at Gaussian Splatting and potentially run some tests on it. As of right now, this seems very promising.
