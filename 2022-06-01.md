# Report June 1st 2022
### Quick note/summary: 
I have been exploring many of the resources that I have been given over the past week. I am also trying to balance spending time with my family and
work as I am trying to make the most out of the time I have with my family before I move back to Claremont and start working in person. This is the first
report about my first week. I believe it has been a bit slow, but I am hoping to speed up and accomplish more in the next couple of days. 
## Activities/Went through: 
  * Terminal/VSCode connecting to server: 
    * Learned to connect with the computers on campus through the terminal and Visual Studio Code. 
    * I started to slowly pick up typing commands like autocomplete(tab), change directory(cd), list(ls), and up arrow to use previous commands. 
    * Learned how to connect with ssh through port forwarding. 
    * Connecting to a repository
    * Creating Jupyter Notebooks
  * FASTAI Lesson 1: 
    * I watched Lesson 1 from the tutorials for FASTAI; however, I only completed the first tutorial partially. 
    * Started to get the hang of jupyter notebooks and learned to create them either in VSCode or in the terminal. 
  * Photogrammetry: 
    * Watched YouTube video on getting started with photogrammetry through the following steps: 
      * Got an idea of the basics from creating the images, take various angles of the subject through different layers. 
        Shoot raw images with higher shutter speeds and smaller apertures, compensate as needed for the correct exposure. 
      * Process the images in Adobe Lightroom CC to get consistency in the exposure, might take a while if one edits image by image. 
        I believe it might be better to expose them properly to make this step easier
      * Process the files through Reality Capture, it seems to be quite a lenghty process in terms of time, but most of the process seems to be automated. 
        I thought this to be very interesting and cool. 
      * Throw the given model into UnrealEngine. I am not sure if this is where the simulation is created or where part of the simulation is created. 
## Problems/ Issues: 
  * I am having a hard time getting back into the workflow and focusing. I am working little by little to get back into working more and more. 
    I expect to be working more next week as I move into a less distracting space. 
  * I have been struggling to get used with the new tools and environments as I have never worked with the terminal/command line, Jupyter Notebooks, machine laerning, 
    or anything that I have seen this week. I am hoping that I as I invest more time with the tutorials and environment, I will solve many of these issues. 
## Plans/Agenda for the Week for June 2nd- June 9th: 
  * Starting to focus more as I start to go in person.
  * Finish Lesson 1 from the tutorials by the end of this week, that is June 3rd. 
  * Watch and finish Lesson 2(maybe 3 and 4 as well) from the tutorials by June 11th. 
  * Read/ look into the "Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks" and "Investigating Neural Network Architectures,
    Techniques, and Datasets for Autonomous Navigation in Simulation" by the end of June 11th. 
  * Attend the Makerspace Tour on Tuesday June 7th.
