# Report June 22nd 2022
### Summary: 
This week has been mainly focused on photogrammetry and experimentation with the software Reality Capture. The two biggest remarks are that it seemed to have done a good
job at combining/ scanning surroundings of a photoshoot, so that if you scan a chair, the background is also quite clear in the model. I hope to use this to take photos from different locatiions to create the courtyard.
THe second is that objects have to be generally in the same position if one decides to scan at different times; after scanning a singular chair with different times and positions, it recognized it as two different objects.  
## Activities: 
  * Photogrammetry: 
    * Experimented with more tools from Reality Capture (filterling tool, cutting by box, smoothing tool)
    * Created a list of potential camera equipment that would help us. 
    * Completed the Digital Production Quiz for the Makerspace
    * Read the Safety Manual for the Makerspace, I intend to take the quiz soon and head to the Makerspace
    * In the process of checking out the Nikon Z7ii from the Makerspace
    * Downloaded the files from the farm after 3 tries, I hope to make a photogrammetric model soon. 
    * Took 270 pictures of a chair in the Estella Courtyard and created a photogrammetric model after editing the images. I took 135 later anc combined, and I found that since the chair was slightly moved on the second batch of photos, then it didn't recognized them as one, but rather as 2 different chairs.
## Problems/Issues:
  * I have been having a hard time trying to figure out how to scan the whole courtyard, and the thought has been pretty intimidating. 
  * However, after created the model for the chair, I realized that Reality Capture did a good job at modeling the surroundings. The next step would be to keep experimenting by taking more photos from different locations of the court, to see if it does a good job at creating a combined model.
## Next Steps: 
  * Working on a bigger model of the court
  * checking out the new camera
  * craeting a model of the farm 
  * craeting a model of the mudd hallway
