# Report of June 29th 2022
### Summary: 
This past week I continued to focus on photogrammetry. With images taken by previous TAs and Prof Los Huertos, I was able to work to create a model. THe model for the Mudd Hallway was successful and insightful while the farm failed. 
We also got to scan the Estella courtyard with areal shots taken by Prof Los Huertos' with his drone Mavic 2 drone; this model was very good for the number of images and limitations to areal shots. We also worked on the Oldenborg Hallway in the first floor; there where some holes in the 
model, but I am hoping to go back to get more efficient images. I want to take less images with more overlap and detail, it is a matter of practice I believe. I also checked out the Nikon Z7ii from the Makerspace. 
## Activities: 
This will be divided into two sections, photogrammetry and photography. The first is a progress report while the second is a description on how I am editing my images in Adobe Lightroom CC. 
  * Photogrammetry: 
    * Edited the images from the Harvey Mudd Hallway taken by Evelyn. I then created thre them into Reality Capture, where we were able to create a model that had enough detail to distinguish many features. The model was good, but there are improvements to be made. I believe the reason why there where holes and 
    some noise in places/ lack of detail was because some of the images were shaky. Nevertheless, the technique used to scan the hallway was generally efficient, it scanned a lot of the space, only lacking detail for smaller/individual assets. 
    * Downloaded and organized the image files from the farm. I did not process these images on Adobe Lightroom CC because there were over 8000 images. All of these images varied in exposure and light conditions. The photogrammetry model failed as the app crashed. I stepped away, but it took a long time. The images
    where both, color and B&W, which. I believe images should be consistent since the textures and colors depend on this. 
    * Went as a team with Professor Los Huertos to scan and take images of the Estella Courtyard on Monday and Tuesday. We were able to create a solid and nice photogrammetry model of the courtyward with the first set of iamges of around 570. These 570 were taken from 
    20-30meters of height. The images taken from lower height were not as successful in being recognized by the program. My hypothesis is because there is not enough overlap between the 20-30 meter high to the ones from the lower height. It was a very nice model, and I am positive moving forward. 
    We decided to step away from the courtyard for a bit. 
    * We went scouting for a good indoor space to scan. We ended up going for Oldenborg Center. We started scanning the first floor. We took around 1220 images with Liz, from which around 770 were recognized by the program. 
    The model was okay and quite solid. We had a bit of trouble recognizing the plain white walls, but the detail was generally okay, a 6/10. There some holes in the model, and we are hoping to go back and take more efficient photos. 
    My idea is to take less images with more detail and overlap. 
 * Photography: 
    * Assuming the images we are working with are generally well framed and exposed: 
      * Exposure:  amount of light collected by your camera, in other words: if an image is overexposed, it is too bright. If it is underexposed, it is too dark. A proper exposure would replicate how the scene looks like in the real world at that moment.
    * We open Lightroom. We then hit import in the bottom left corner. We select the images we want to work with. 
    * After selecting the images we hit import once again in the right bottom corner of the window. 
    * After the images load, we can go to the develop, were we can balance the image to what we want to work with. For us, we want an image that is properly exposed, and we want the shadows and highlights to be balanced. 
    * We want to either increase the exposure or decrease to balance the scene. If the image is properly exposed already, we won't want to go over or under 1. That is, we keep it between -1 and 1. 
    * We want to decraese highlights to -100, and increase shadows to 100. 
    * The image should be flat. I will be uploading a folder with images. See Lightroom folder for reference.
    * We export as JPEG with the highest quality(not required, 70 and above should be okay).
 * Other: 
    * Completed the Digital Production Quiz for the Makerspace and checked out the Nikon Z7ii with a 24-70mm f/4 lens. 
    * Read the paper for this week.
## Issues: 
  * This week the issues were mainly photography issues. I am new to taking images for photogrammetry, so I am learning was is useful and what isn't. This week I plan to scan wit more overlap and detail. I will head to Olderborg as soon as I can. 
  * I am looking into more photography images for photogrammetry. I am also looking into equipment and techniques that could help us. 
## Next Steps:
* I want to look into scanning equipment for indoor photogrammetry. I am looking to explore with the LiDar scanners. 
* I am trying to find a paper for next week. 
* Explore more with indoor photogrammetry scanning. I will scanning Oldenborg Center.
* Play with the new camera!
