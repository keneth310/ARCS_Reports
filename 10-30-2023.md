# Report October 30th 2023
### Quick note/summary: 
This week I focused on running a NeRF model. I was able to get the demos running, and I am currently working on creating a model with our own photos. I am working on recreating a NeRF model we ran last year. 
## Activities/Went through: 
  * NeRF Model:
    * In the process of creating a model. Running into some issues:
      * cholmod.dll and spqr.dll not found when running commands from: https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp#installation and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TWxO1PftMc
      * tried running colmap.bat, does not take raw images.  

## Moving Forward(in order): 
  * Finish the model with NeRF. Here are some steps:
    * Edit images so that they are jpg format.
    * Ask for help with the dll not found.
    * I would like to know a little more about where I am headed. While I have been running some models, I am wondering what the end goal might look like.  
  * Get a model going with LumaAI's video to 3D API data feature. Get the code going, and then get a video of an object to get going.
  * Get a model running with LumaAI's application(it is rendeing and preprocessing as of October 9th.
  * Look into interactive scenes here: https://lumalabs.ai/interactive-scenes
  * Either this week or the one after, I want to look at Gaussian Splatting and potentially run some tests on it. As of right now, this seems very promising.
  * Access to the lab would be amazing to start running the above!
