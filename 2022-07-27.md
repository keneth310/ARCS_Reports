| 7/22 | Out sick  
| 7/25 | Worked on the model that I left off with, it was the one with high detail. The model was just okay, I reviewed the images and it seems that some images were shaky. 
| 7/26 | I read the paper. Then I edited the 175 images that I left off with. I generated a model, but it didn't seem to have joined the different components right, even after using control points.   
| 7/27 | Went to oldernborg to take pictures of the first floor(900ish images) and created a model with the LiDAR Scanner in my phone. I tried working with this mesh and seeing what could be done with it. 
# Activities: 
  * Created a high detail model with the 650 images. It took some time because the first one crashed, but this one turned out to be okay. I believe there have been better ones in normal reconstruction of the mesh. 
  * Went through the data set and realized some of the images were shaky and with some weird lighting. 
  * Created the model with the 175, did not come back as expected. 
  * Took photos of Oldenborg, and I am in the process of editing them.
  * Created a LiDAR Scan with my phone and Polycam. I played around to see if this could be used, it seems it might be hard to use it. It is not a possibility in RC. UE5 took, but it wasn't as expected, I will see if anyone can import it better than I did. 
# Problems: 
  * I am still trying to create better models 
  * LiDAR Polycam scan seems to not be as useful despite looking good. https://poly.cam/capture/B5AF8E27-CC42-4A96-9D95-967616F8CE88
# Next Steps: 
  * I believe I will be done this week with the summer, but I would love to continue working on the models 
  * Plan would be to invest time using Zbrush and blender to explore the creation of models. 
  * work the LiDAR Scanner to see if it is any useful.
