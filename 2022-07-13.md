# Report of July 13th 2022
## Summary: 
| Date | Tasks
| :--        |:--   |
| 7/7 | Wrote my report for last week. I spent the rest of the day reading and watching videos on how to improve my photogrammetry models. 
| 7/8 | I spent all day looking into how to create better photogrammetry models.  
| 7/11 | Created a model with pictures from last week. I tried to play around with control points, and got a good combined photogrammetry model.
| 7/12 | I started playing with RC on craeting high detail meshes. I got a mesh that was not much different than before; however, it seems that it might yield better results. Went to Oldenborg to take 175 images.  
| 7/13 | Worked on craeting the high detail mesh and model. I had some trouble with space, so I am pausing that to clean up the disk a bit and get the computer ready to handle high detail. I need to detail several 100s of GB of data from the past couple of weeks. 
## Activities: 
  * Photogrammetry: 
    * Created the normal detail photogrammetry model with 650 images. 570/650 were recognized, better from last week. Got this by playing with control point. 
    * However, it seems, like the union of these models is a bit choppy, the floor seemed a bit broken in the union points. 
    * Working with high detail meshes, hoping for better results. 
    * I have been reading and watching videos on creating better results, better images seem to be the best bet, but also the sharpening on the model. 

## Problems: Generally same as last week
  * The models from RC, although better from before, are still noisy and not as sharp as we wish them to be.
    I plan to read more on why there is noise and how to sharpen these models so that we start getting more realistic models. 
  * I plan to keep working on my skills to create better photogrammetry models. 
  * The difference from last week is that I have an idea of where to go from now on. 
## Next Steps: 
  * Work with the tools that RC has to create better models, that includes control points, merge components, unwrapping, and also cleaning up the models. 
  * Work with ZBrush to clean up the models and get sharper results. I need to get a trial license for this one. 
  * Keep on perfecting the models. 
  * Try creating another scan with LiDAR.
